## Overview

**Tills AGI** introduces a groundbreaking framework for Artificial General Intelligence by integrating experiences, memories, instincts, learnings, and real-time inputs into composite cognitive units called **Tills**. Inspired by the natural complexity of human cognition—and named after my daughter, Tilly—this framework is designed to move beyond the "Big AI" paradigm. Rather than relying on massive compute resources and enormous curated datasets, Tills AGI is engineered to learn and operate efficiently in resource-constrained environments, dynamically prioritizing and processing information in a context-sensitive manner.

In this repository, you will find:

- **Framework Documentation:** Detailed explanations of the Tills Framework, its motivation, and its place within current AGI research.
- **Simulation Code:** Python simulations that demonstrate the core principles of Tills AGI, including dynamic retrieval, prioritization, and feedback-based learning.
- **Neural Network Integration:** Discussions and examples on enhancing the Tills Framework with neural network–based storage and retrieval mechanisms for real-time decision-making without the need for "Big AI" resources.

## Framework Overview

The **Tills Framework** is built on the following principles:

- **Composite Cognitive Units:**  
  Tills integrate multiple facets of cognition—memory, instinct, and real-time input—into a unified entity, much like the human brain stores memories and instincts.

- **Dynamic Interaction and Prioritization:**  
  Multiple Tills interact in parallel, with a dynamic mechanism continuously evaluating which Till is most relevant to the current context.

- **State-Dependent Processing:**  
  The AGI can operate in different states (e.g., "awake" and "dream") to handle immediate decision-making and offline processing.

- **Integrated, Human-Like Cognition:**  
  By blending past experiences with real-time sensory data, Tills enable context-sensitive decision-making that mirrors human cognitive flexibility.

Additionally, this framework leverages modern neural network techniques to encode, store, and retrieve Tills efficiently, offering a robust solution that is well-suited for environments with limited computational resources.

## Simulation Code

The repository contains Python simulation code that illustrates the core principles of the Tills Framework. The simulation demonstrates:

- How Tills are defined with cognitive attributes (memory, instinct, real-time input) and metadata (contexts, objectives, goal priorities, and rules).
- A dynamic scoring function that selects the most relevant Till based on the current decision context and the AGI's objectives.
- Execution of actions associated with selected Tills.
- Feedback mechanisms to update and potentially create new Tills based on outcomes.

**Work in Progress:**  
We are actively developing a Proof-of-Concept (POC) that will run entirely on a local developer's workstation. Over the coming weeks, updates will expand the simulation to include:

- A lightweight neural network encoder to generate embeddings for Tills.
- Virtual representations of robotic and IoT devices simulating sensory inputs.
- Demonstrations of both "awake" (real-time decision-making) and "dream" (offline consolidation) processing states.
- Enhanced feedback loops showcasing adaptive, human-like learning.

## Final Thoughts

The Tills AGI framework represents a pioneering step toward achieving truly integrated, context-sensitive artificial intelligence without the dependency on "Big AI"—massive compute power and enormous datasets. By unifying diverse cognitive elements within dynamic, feedback-driven units and harnessing efficient neural network techniques for rapid semantic retrieval, the Tills Framework addresses key challenges in current AGI research. We invite you to explore, experiment, and contribute to this exciting journey toward scalable, resource-efficient intelligent systems.
