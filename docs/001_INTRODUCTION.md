# 001 Introduction to the Tills Framework and Motivation

## Abstract

The Tills Framework introduces a groundbreaking approach for AGI in which the basic cognitive units—termed **Tills**—serve as composite repositories that integrate experiences, memories, intuition, learning, and instincts. Unlike conventional modular approaches, Tills are designed to mirror the dynamic interplay of human cognition, enabling an AGI to process and prioritize information in a context-sensitive manner. By leveraging neural network–based storage and retrieval mechanisms, the framework offers a flexible, efficient, and continually adaptive cognitive architecture that addresses key challenges in current AGI development.

## 1. Introduction

The pursuit of Artificial General Intelligence has long been challenged by the difficulty of replicating the rich, dynamic, and context-dependent processes of human thought. Traditional approaches often divide cognitive functions into isolated modules—such as memory, learning, and sensory processing—resulting in fragmented decision-making. The Tills Framework overcomes these limitations by conceptualizing Tills as composite cognitive units that integrate multiple facets of cognition. This unified approach not only stores diverse experiences but also dynamically evaluates and prioritizes them based on real-time needs and overarching AGI objectives.

## 2. Overview and Key Concepts

### 2.1 Composite Cognitive Units

At the heart of the Tills Framework is the concept of the **Till**—a fundamental unit that encapsulates a spectrum of cognitive properties, including:

- **Memory:** Stored experiences and learned behaviors.
- **Instinct:** Hard-wired, immediate responses.
- **Real-Time Input:** Ongoing sensory and situational data.

Each Till functions as a mini repository of knowledge, much like the human brain maintains a rich database of memories and instincts. This composite structure enables the system to draw from a vast and varied pool of information when making decisions.

### 2.2 Dynamic Interaction and Prioritization

Cognition is a dynamic process where multiple streams of information interact continuously. Within the Tills Framework:

- **Continuous Evaluation:** Multiple Tills operate in parallel, with their relevance being assessed in real time.
- **Selective Recall:** A dedicated mechanism determines which Till best fits the current context—mirroring how humans select the most pertinent memory or instinct.

This dynamic prioritization is central to achieving adaptive and flexible decision-making, as the AGI continuously updates and ranks its cognitive resources based on current inputs.

### 2.3 State-Dependent Processing

Inspired by the human brain’s alternation between active and offline processing modes, the Tills Framework supports two primary operational states:

- **Active (“Awake”) State:**  
  In this state, the AGI processes sensory inputs, makes immediate decisions, and executes actions. Techniques such as reinforcement learning, few-shot learning, continual learning, and the integration of symbolic with deep learning enable rapid, real-time responses.

- **Offline (“Dream”) State:**  
  In the offline state, the system consolidates, reorganizes, and simulates experiences—similar to how human dreaming facilitates memory consolidation and creative problem-solving. Techniques like meta-learning, transfer learning, continual learning, and symbolic + deep learning work together to refine internal models and generate new strategies.

Separating these states—even with abundant compute power—optimizes resource allocation, minimizes interference between processes, and enhances overall learning and adaptation.

### 2.4 Integrated, Human-Like Cognition: Feedback, Action, and Adaptive Learning

By blending real-time sensory inputs with a rich archive of past experiences, the Tills Framework aims to replicate the fluidity and nuance of human thought. The continuous interplay and selective recall of Tills empower the AGI to adapt seamlessly to complex and novel environments—an essential step toward achieving true general intelligence.

External feedback—whether from neural network outputs in simulations or sensor data from robotic and IoT devices—plays a crucial role in this process. Feedback is used in two primary ways:

1. **Updating Existing Tills:**  
   When an action is executed and feedback is received, the parameters (such as memory, instinct, and real-time weightings) of the involved Tills are updated, refining their cognitive representation for improved performance in future similar scenarios.

2. **Creating New Tills:**  
   If feedback indicates that current experiences are not adequately captured—especially in novel or extreme events—the system generates a new Till that encapsulates the fresh experience, thereby enriching the overall knowledge base.

#### Example 1: Neural Network Integration in a Simulated Environment

An AGI system in a virtual simulation processes real-time visual and sensory inputs through a deep encoder network that generates embeddings stored as part of the Tills. The system selects a Till based on a composite score and executes an action (e.g., navigating a complex maze). If feedback signals a suboptimal outcome (such as a collision), the neural network fine-tunes its embeddings and updates the Tills accordingly. For unexpected scenarios, a new Till is created to capture novel features, enhancing future decision-making.

#### Example 2: Feedback from Robotic Devices and IoT Sensors

In a real-world application, an AGI system controls a robotic arm in a manufacturing plant, with IoT sensors monitoring its performance and environmental conditions. When sensor data reveals deviations—due to mechanical faults or environmental changes—the system processes the feedback to update the relevant Tills. If a completely new anomaly is detected, the system generates a new Till to encapsulate the fresh experience, thereby bolstering the system’s adaptability and resilience.

In both examples, the interplay of external feedback, neural network adjustments, and the dynamic creation or updating of Tills enables the AGI to continuously evolve. This integration of real-time inputs with an adaptive memory system helps the AGI mimic the fluid and nuanced decision-making characteristic of human cognition.
